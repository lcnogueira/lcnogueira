# hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiz ClÃ¡udio (you can call me Luiz ðŸ˜‰ ), and I currently work (remotely) as a Senior Javascript Engineer at [10up](https://10up.com). I'm responsible for creating and delivering different kinds of projects according to our client's needs and budget. Most of the time, I use React + Nexjts (for web apps) or React Native (for mobile apps) to build those projects.
