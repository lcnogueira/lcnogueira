# hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiz ClÃ¡udio (you can call me Luiz ðŸ˜‰), and I currently work (remotely) as a Software Engineer at [AE Studio](http://ae.studio). I'm responsible for creating and delivering different kinds of projects according to our client's needs and budget. Most of the time, I use React + Nexjts (for web apps) or React Native (for mobile apps) to build those projects.

You can reach out to me via [e-mail](mailto:luizcns18@gmail.com) or you can take a look at [my blog](https://lcnogueira.com) (it's not updated, though...ðŸ˜¢) and find additional links.
